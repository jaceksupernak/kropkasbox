Kropka is a very fat and grumpy cat. She lives in a council flat in Poland. She has a box. She does not want you to have the box or know what is inside it. Do not attempt to take the box. Do not attempt to open the box. Even if she is asleep - she will know what youâ€™ve done with the box.

Below is top secret information - don't tell Kropka

Kropka's box is full of whimsical cartoons observing the strange nature of life and death, featuring animals such as pigs, cats, mice, badgers, bears and humans.

The cartoons are drawn by Mariella Hudson, an Irish-Peruvian who is also a writer-actor-director. She would like to draw more cartoons that feature Kropka, but Kropka is generally too grumpy to agree to this.
